# Hi, I'm Olal üëãüèø

I'm a software developer and technical leader based in Nairobi, Kenya, with experience in product management and cybersecurity.

I primarily work with React, Flutter, TypeScript, and JavaScript, while exploring AI/ML and Web3 technologies. Currently learning Kubernetes for container orchestration.

My focus areas include scalable architectures, AI integrations, and full-stack innovation.

I also have a background in cybersecurity and penetration testing, with experience in SIEM implementation and vulnerability assessments.

## Work

I'm a freelance developer specializing in interactive web applications and mobile apps. I build dynamic solutions using React.js, TypeScript, and modern frameworks with emphasis on scalability and performance. I also mentor developers and collaborate with clients to bring their ideas to life.

Previously, as a tech lead, I developed diverse enterprise solutions including an airport lounge management system, healthcare portal, and credit risk calculation system.
